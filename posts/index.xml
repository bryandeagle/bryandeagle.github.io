            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most fun things to play around with today is a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>. I&rsquo;m constantly re-imaging my Raspberry Pi ,a nd so this guide walks through steps to take each time to ensure your device is sufficiently secure.</p>
<p>The security of your Raspberry Pi is important. Gaps in security leave your Raspberry Pi open to hackers who can then use it without your permission.</p>
<p>What level of security you need depends on how you wish to use your Raspberry Pi. For example, if you are simply using your Raspberry Pi on your home network, behind a router with a firewall, then it is already quite secure by default.</p>
<p>However, if you wish to expose your Raspberry Pi directly to the internet, either with a direct connection (unlikely) or by letting certain protocols through your router firewall (e.g. SSH), then you need to make some basic security changes.</p>
<p>Even if you are hidden behind a firewall, it is sensible to take security seriously. This documentation will describe some ways of improving the security of your Raspberry Pi. Please note, though, that it is not exhaustive.</p>
<h2 id="change-your-default-password">Change your default password</h2>
<p>The default username and password is used for every single Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS. So, if you can get access to a Raspberry Pi, and these settings have not been changed, you have <code>root</code> access to that Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>So the first thing to do is change the password. This can be done via the raspi-config application, or from the command line.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo raspi-config
</code></pre></div><p>Select option 2, and follow the instructions to change the password.</p>
<p>In fact, all raspi-config does is start up the command line <code>passwd</code> application, which you can do from the command line. Simply type in your new password and confirm it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">passwd
</code></pre></div><h2 id="changing-your-username">Changing your username</h2>
<p>You can, of course, make your Raspberry Pi even more secure by also changing your username. All Raspberry Pis come with the default username <code>pi</code>, so changing this will immediately make your Raspberry Pi more secure.</p>
<p>To add a new user, enter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo adduser alice
</code></pre></div><p>You will be prompted to create a password for the new user.</p>
<p>The new user will have a home directory at <code>/home/alice/</code>.</p>
<p>To add them to the <code>sudo</code> group to give them <code>sudo</code> permissions as well as all of the other necessary permissions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo usermod -a -G adm,dialout,cdrom,sudo,audio,video,plugdev,games,users,input,netdev,gpio,i2c,spi alice
</code></pre></div><p>You can check your permissions are in place (i.e. you can use <code>sudo</code>) by trying the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo su - alice
</code></pre></div><p>If it runs successfully, then you can be sure that the new account is in the <code>sudo</code> group.</p>
<p>Once you have confirmed that the new account is working, you can delete the <code>pi</code> user. In order to do this, you&rsquo;ll need to first close its process with the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo pkill -u pi
</code></pre></div><p>Please note that with the current Raspberry Pi OS distribution, there are some aspects that require the <code>pi</code> user to be present. If you are unsure whether you will be affected by this, then leave the <code>pi</code> user in place. Work is being done to reduce the dependency on the <code>pi</code> user.</p>
<p>To delete the <code>pi</code> user, type the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo deluser pi
</code></pre></div><p>This command will delete the <code>pi</code> user but will leave the <code>/home/pi</code> folder. If necessary, you can use the command below to remove the home folder for the <code>pi</code> user at the same time. Note the data in this folder will be permanently deleted, so make sure any required data is stored elsewhere.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo deluser -remove-home pi
</code></pre></div><p>This command will result in a warning that the group <code>pi</code> has no more members. The <code>deluser</code> command removes both the <code>pi</code> user and the <code>pi</code> group though, so the warning can be safely ignored.</p>
<h2 id="make-sudo-require-a-password">Make <code>sudo</code> require a password</h2>
<p>Placing <code>sudo</code> in front of a command runs it as a superuser, and by default, that does not need a password. In general, this is not a problem. However, if your Pi is exposed to the internet and somehow becomes exploited (perhaps via a webpage exploit for example), the attacker will be able to change things that require superuser credentials, unless you have set <code>sudo</code> to require a password.</p>
<p>To force <code>sudo</code> to require a password, enter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo visudo /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd
</code></pre></div><p>and change the <code>pi</code> entry (or whichever usernames have superuser rights) to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">pi ALL<span style="color:#f92672">=(</span>ALL<span style="color:#f92672">)</span> PASSWD: ALL
</code></pre></div><p>Then save the file: it will be checked for any syntax errors. If no errors were detected, the file will be saved and you will be returned to the shell prompt. If errors were detected, you will be asked &lsquo;what now?&rsquo; Press the &lsquo;enter&rsquo; key on your keyboard: this will bring up a list of options. You will probably want to use &lsquo;e&rsquo; for &lsquo;(e)dit sudoers file again,&rsquo; so you can edit the file and fix the problem. <strong>Note that choosing option &lsquo;Q&rsquo; will save the file with any syntax errors still in place, which makes it impossible for <em>any</em> user to use the sudo command.</strong></p>
<h2 id="ensure-you-have-the-latest-security-fixes">Ensure you have the latest security fixes</h2>
<p>This can be as simple as ensuring your version of Raspberry Pi OS is up-to-date, as an up-to-date distribution contains all the latest security fixes. Full instructions can be found <a href="../raspbian/updating.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using SSH to connect to your Raspberry Pi, it can be worthwhile to add a cron job that specifically updates the ssh-server. The following command, perhaps as a daily cron job, will ensure you have the latest SSH security fixes promptly, independent of your normal update process. More information on setting up cron can be found <a href="../linux/usage/cron.md">here</a></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">apt install openssh-server
</code></pre></div><h2 id="improving-ssh-security">Improving SSH security</h2>
<p>SSH is a common way of accessing a Raspberry Pi remotely. By default, logging in with SSH requires a username/password pair, and there are ways to make this more secure. An even more secure method is to use key based authentication.</p>
<h3 id="improving-usernamepassword-security">Improving username/password security</h3>
<p>The most important thing to do is ensure you have a very robust password. If your Raspberry Pi is exposed to the internet, the password needs to be very secure. This will help to avoid dictionary attacks or the like.</p>
<p>You can also <strong>allow</strong> or <strong>deny</strong> specific users by altering the <code>sshd</code> configuration.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
</code></pre></div><p>Add, edit, or append to the end of the file the following line, which contains the usernames you wish to allow to log in:</p>
<pre><code>AllowUsers alice bob
</code></pre><p>You can also use <code>DenyUsers</code> to specifically stop some usernames from logging in:</p>
<pre><code>DenyUsers jane john
</code></pre><p>After the change you will need to restart the <code>sshd</code> service using <code>sudo systemctl restart ssh</code> or reboot so the changes take effect.</p>
<h3 id="using-key-based-authentication">Using key-based authentication.</h3>
<p>Key pairs are two cryptographically secure keys. One is private, and one is public. They can be used to authenticate a client to an SSH server (in this case the Raspberry Pi).</p>
<p>The client generates two keys, which are cryptographically linked to each other. The private key should never be released, but the public key can be freely shared. The SSH server takes a copy of the public key, and, when a link is requested, uses this key to send the client a challenge message, which the client will encrypt using the private key. If the server can use the public key to decrypt this message back to the original challenge message, then the identity of the client can be confirmed.</p>
<p>Generating a key pair in Linux is done using the <code>ssh-keygen</code> command on the <strong>client</strong>; the keys are stored by default in the <code>.ssh</code> folder in the user&rsquo;s home directory. The private key will be called <code>id_rsa</code> and the associated public key will be called <code>id_rsa.pub</code>. The key will be 2048 bits long: breaking the encryption on a key of that length would take an extremely long time, so it is very secure. You can make longer keys if the situation demands it. Note that you should only do the generation process once: if repeated, it will overwrite any previous generated keys. Anything relying on those old keys will need to be updated to the new keys.</p>
<p>You will be prompted for a passphrase during key generation: this is an extra level of security. For the moment, leave this blank.</p>
<p>The public key now needs to be moved on to the server: see <a href="../remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md#copy-your-public-key-to-your-raspberry-pi">Copy your public key to your Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to disable password logins, so that all authentication is done by the key pairs.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
</code></pre></div><p>There are three lines that need to be changed to <code>no</code>, if they are not set that way already:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM no
</code></pre></div><p>Save the file and either restart the ssh system with <code>sudo service ssh reload</code> or reboot.</p>
<h2 id="install-a-firewall">Install a firewall</h2>
<p>There are many firewall solutions available for Linux. Most use the underlying <a href="http://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html">iptables</a> project to provide packet filtering. This project sits over the Linux netfiltering system. <code>iptables</code> is installed by default on Raspberry Pi OS, but is not set up. Setting it up can be a complicated task, and one project that provides a simpler interface than <code>iptables</code> is <a href="https://www.linux.com/learn/introduction-uncomplicated-firewall-ufw">ufw</a>, which stands for &lsquo;Uncomplicated Fire Wall&rsquo;. This is the default firewall tool in Ubuntu, and can be easily installed on your Raspberry Pi:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo apt install ufw
</code></pre></div><p><code>ufw</code> is a fairly straightforward command line tool, although there are some GUIs available for it. This document will describe a few of the basic command line options. Note that <code>ufw</code> needs to be run with superuser privileges, so all commands are preceded with <code>sudo</code>. It is also possible to use the option <code>--dry-run</code> any <code>ufw</code> commands, which indicates the results of the command without actually making any changes.</p>
<p>To enable the firewall, which will also ensure it starts up on boot, use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo ufw enable
</code></pre></div><p>To disable the firewall, and disable start up on boot, use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo ufw disable
</code></pre></div><p>Allow a particular port to have access (we have used port 22 in our example):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo ufw allow <span style="color:#ae81ff">22</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Denying access on a port is also very simple (again, we have used port 22 as an example):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo ufw deny <span style="color:#ae81ff">22</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can also specify which service you are allowing or denying on a port. In this example, we are denying tcp on port 22:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo ufw deny 22/tcp
</code></pre></div><p>You can specify the service even if you do not know which port it uses. This example allows the ssh service access through the firewall:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo ufw allow ssh
</code></pre></div><p>The status command lists all current settings for the firewall:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo ufw status
</code></pre></div><p>The rules can be quite complicated, allowing specific IP addresses to be blocked, specifying in which direction traffic is allowed, or limiting the number of attempts to connect, for example to help defeat a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. You can also specify the device rules are to be applied to (e.g. eth0, wlan0). Please refer to the <code>ufw</code> man page (<code>man ufw</code>) for full details, but here are some examples of more sophisticated commands.</p>
<p>Limit login attempts on ssh port using tcp: this denies connection if an IP address has attempted to connect six or more times in the last 30 seconds:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo ufw limit ssh/tcp
</code></pre></div><p>Deny access to port 30 from IP address 192.168.2.1</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo ufw deny from 192.168.2.1 port <span style="color:#ae81ff">30</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="installing-fail2ban">Installing fail2ban</h2>
<p>If you are using your Raspberry Pi as some sort of server, for example an <code>ssh</code> or a webserver, your firewall will have deliberate &lsquo;holes&rsquo; in it to let the server traffic through. In these cases, <a href="http://www.fail2ban.org">Fail2ban</a> can be useful. Fail2ban, written in Python, is a scanner that examines the log files produced by the Raspberry Pi, and checks them for suspicious activity. It catches things like multiple brute-force attempts to log in, and can inform any installed firewall to stop further login attempts from suspicious IP addresses. It saves you having to manually check log files for intrusion attempts and then update the firewall (via <code>iptables</code>) to prevent them.</p>
<p>Install fail2ban using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo apt install fail2ban
</code></pre></div><p>On installation, Fail2ban creates a folder <code>/etc/fail2ban</code> in which there is a configuration file called <code>jail.conf</code>. This needs to be copied to <code>jail.local</code> to enable it. Inside this configuration file are a set of default options, together with options for checking specific services for abnormalities. Do the following to examine/change the rules that are used for <code>ssh</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
</code></pre></div><p>Add the following section to the <code>jail.conf</code> file. On some versions of fail2ban this section may already exist, so update this pre-existing section it if it is there.</p>
<pre><code>[ssh]
enabled  = true
port     = ssh
filter   = sshd
logpath  = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 6
</code></pre><p>As you can see, this section is named ssh, is enabled, examines the ssh port, filters using the <code>sshd</code> parameters, parses the <code>/var/log/auth.log</code> for malicious activity, and allows six retries before the detection threshold is reached. Checking the default section, we can see that the default banning action is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e"># Default banning action (e.g. iptables, iptables-new,</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># iptables-multiport, shorewall, etc) It is used to define</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># action_* variables. Can be overridden globally or per</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># section within jail.local file</span>
banaction <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> iptables-multiport
</code></pre></div><p><code>iptables-multiport</code> means that the Fail2ban system will run the <code>/etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf</code> file when the detection threshold is reached. There are a number of different action configuration files that can be used. Multiport bans all access on all ports.</p>
<p>If you want to permanently ban an IP address after three failed attempts, you can change the maxretry value in the <code>[ssh]</code> section, and set the bantime to a negative number:</p>
<pre><code>[ssh]
enabled  = true
port     = ssh
filter   = sshd
logpath  = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3
bantime = -1
</code></pre><p>There is a good tutorial on some of the internals of Fail2ban <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-fail2ban-works-to-protect-services-on-a-linux-server">here</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll discuss TLS/SSL certificates. To learn more than just the theory, I&rsquo;ll be acting as my own Certificate Authority, which will allow me to generate all the required files for TLS/SSL communication.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ssltls">What is SSL/TLS?</h2>
<p>SSL and TLS are both cryptographic protocols used to increase security by encrypting communication over computer networks. SSL stands for <strong>Secure Sockets Layer</strong> while TLS stands for <strong>Transport Layer Security</strong>. TLS is the successor of SSL 3.0 and is now the standard (although both methods are still commonly referred to as SSL).</p>
<h2 id="becoming-a-certificate-authority">Becoming a Certificate Authority</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-generate-a-key">Step 1. Generate a key</h3>
<pre><code>openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 2048
</code></pre><p>In this command, we&rsquo;re using the <strong>openssl</strong> tool to generate an RSA key (<strong>genrsa</strong>). With the <strong>-des3</strong> option, we&rsquo;re using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES">triple DES</a> engine to encrypt the key. This option requires us to use a password whenever we want to use this key, which adds an essential layer of security.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re telling the openssl tool to generate a key <strong>2048</strong> bits long, and output to <strong>ca.key</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-generate-a-root-certificate">Step 2. Generate a Root Certificate</h3>
<pre><code>openssl req -new -x509 -key ca.key -sha256 -days 365000 -out ca.pem
</code></pre><p>The <strong>openssl req</strong> command creates and processes certificate requests. It can also create self-signed certificates, which is what we&rsquo;re using it for, by giving it the <strong>-new -x509</strong> options.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using the <strong>sha256</strong> digest to sign this certificate with our previously generated key, <strong>ca.key</strong>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also making this certificate valid for 1,000 years (365000 days) because it&rsquo;s self-signed, so expiry isn&rsquo;t too important.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You are now officially a <strong>Certificate Authority</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="getting-people-to-trust-your-authority">Getting People to Trust Your Authority</h2>
<p>Being a Certificate Authority doesn&rsquo;t mean much if nobody respects your authority.</p>
<p>The real Certificate Authorities will join, for example, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/program-requirements">Microsoft&rsquo;s Trusted Root Program</a> and have their certificates automatically installed on all Windows distributions.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re just generating these for personal use, we&rsquo;ll have to manually install them on every device we want to trust us.</p>
<h3 id="1-installation-on-windows">1. Installation on Windows</h3>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the <strong>certificate.crt</strong> file</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Install Certificate…</strong> then <strong>Current User</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Place all certificates in the following store</strong></li>
<li>Browse to <strong>Trusted Root Certificate Authorities</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Next</strong> and then click <strong>Finish</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-installation-on-android">2. Installation on Android</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong>Security</strong> » <strong>Encryption &amp; credentials</strong></li>
<li>Go to <strong>Install from storage</strong> and select your certificate</li>
<li>Give the certificate a memorable name and select <strong>Wi-Fi</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-installation-on-macos">3. Installation on MacOS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open the macOS Keychain app, and go to <strong>File &gt; Import Items…</strong></li>
<li>Select your private key file, then search for the Common Name name</li>
<li>Double click on your certificate and expand the Trust section</li>
<li>Change <strong>When using this certificate</strong> to <strong>Always Trust</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k &quot;/Library/Keychains/System.keychain&quot; certificate.crt
</code></pre><h3 id="4-installation-on-ios">4. Installation on iOS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong>Profile Downloaded</strong> » <strong>Install</strong></li>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong>General</strong> » <strong>About</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom and select <strong>Certificate Trust Settings</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Enable Full Trust for Root Certificates</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="signing-certificates-as-a-certificate-authority">Signing Certificates as a Certificate Authority</h2>
<p>For SSL/TLS, web servers need two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A private key, to encrypt traffic</li>
<li>A certificate, which serves as a public key and proof the webserver in question owns the domain.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="step-1-generate-a-private-key">Step 1. Generate a Private Key</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s helpful (but not necessary) to name the key, and all files we generate, based on the webserver we&rsquo;re running. In our example, we&rsquo;ll use <em>example.com</em>.</p>
<pre><code>openssl genrsa -out example.com.key 2048
</code></pre><p>This time we won&rsquo;t be password-protecting this key with the <strong>-des3</strong> option, like we did with our Root CA key.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-generate-a-certificate-signing-request">Step 2. Generate a Certificate Signing Request</h3>
<p>Even though we&rsquo;re the ones signing our certificate, in most situations, a different entity will be signing our certificate, so the workflow is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a certificate signing request</li>
<li>Fulfill the certificate signing request with our ca private key</li>
</ol>
<p>We generate the certificate signing request (CSR) with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>openssl req -new -key example.com.key -out example.com.csr
</code></pre><p>We&rsquo;ll also need to configure the proper extensions for the certificate to work with most protocols. For that we&rsquo;ll create an extension config file, named example.com.ext, with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = example.com
</code></pre><h3 id="step-3-fulfill-the-certificate-signing-request">Step 3. Fulfill the Certificate Signing Request</h3>
<p>We fulfill our certificate signing process by generating our new certificate, signed with our Root Certificate Authority key.</p>
<pre><code>openssl x509 -req -in example.com.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out example.com.crt -days 825 -sha256 -extfile example.com.ext
</code></pre><p>We should now have <strong>example.com.crt</strong> to go along with our <strong>example.com.key</strong>, which is all we need to enable TLS/SSL on our website. Below is an example of an Apache configuration that utilizes our newly generated certificate and key.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
        ServerName example.com
        ...
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
        ServerName example.com
        ...
        SSLCertificateFile /opt/cert/example.com.crt
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /opt/cert/example.com.key
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>]]></content>

            <title>An Overview of the HTTPS Protocol</title>
            <link>https://dea.gl/posts/an-overview-of-the-https-protocol/</link>

            <description>How HTTPS Works Type facebook.com into your web browser, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see a little lock appear to the left of the URL. That lock means you are using HTTPS and signifies that your connection to facebook.com is secure.
Using HTTPS over the older, not secure, HTTP has two benefits:
 The website your browser is talking to has proven itself to be facebook.com and is not just pretending to be. The communications your browser sends to the website are encrypted so that no-one except your browser and the website can read them.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="how-https-works">How HTTPS Works</h2>
<p>Type facebook.com into your web browser, and you&rsquo;ll see a little lock appear to the left of the URL. That lock means you are using <em>HTTPS</em> and signifies that your connection to facebook.com is secure.</p>
<p>Using HTTPS over the older, not secure, HTTP has two benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>The website your browser is talking to has proven itself to be facebook.com and is not just pretending to be.</li>
<li>The communications your browser sends to the website are encrypted so that no-one except your browser and the website can read them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those communications can include usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other critical information you wouldn&rsquo;t want in the hands of anyone but the real facebook.com.</p>
<h2 id="ensuring-identity">Ensuring Identity</h2>
<p>Your browser trusts that the website truly is facebook.com because it has presented us with a <em>certificate</em> stating it is facebook.com. If you click the lock on your browser, you can view it yourself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should you trust that certificate, you ask?&rdquo; Great question. Because, like real-world certificates, someone you should trust has signed it.</p>
<p>Inspecting facebook.com&rsquo;s certificate shows that DigiCert signed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on. Who is DigiCert, and why should I trust them?&rdquo; you ask. Another great question. I like where your head&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>Digicert is a <em>Certificate Authority</em>. That means they are an organization able to sign certificates to prove that they are valid.</p>
<p>I trust DigiCert because Microsoft trusts them, and because I run Windows, I have no choice but to trust Microsoft. Because Microsoft trusts DigiCert as a Certificate Authority, Windows trusts certificates signed by DigiCert.</p>
<p>You can view this information by searching for <strong>Manage computer certificates</strong> in your start menu. From there, click on <strong>Trusted Root Certification Authorities »  Certificates</strong>, and in that long list, you should see DigiCert.</p>
<p>Microsoft also publishes the list of Certificate Authorities <a href="https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/microsoft/IncludedCACertificateReportForMSFT">here</a>. On that page, you can find DigiCert as well.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the chain of trust. You trust Microsoft because you run their operating system. Microsoft has said you can trust what DigiCert says. And finally, DigiCert has said, you can trust the server you&rsquo;re talking to is facebook.com.</p>
<p>You can rest easy knowing you&rsquo;re not sending private information to somebody pretending to be facebook.com.</p>
<h2 id="ensuring-privacy">Ensuring Privacy</h2>
<p>Even though that&rsquo;s the real facebook.com, who might be able to intercept those communications and read your private data? That&rsquo;s an easy enough question to answer. On Windows, open up a command prompt and type:</p>
<pre><code>tracert facebook.com
</code></pre><p>On Linux or Mac OS, type:</p>
<pre><code>traceroute facebook.com
</code></pre><p>That command displays all the intermediate servers your communications go through before making it to facebook.com. Each line is a different server, and the first line is likely your router.</p>
<p>Each item between your router and facebook.com is another server capable of reading all the unencrypted information you send to facebook.com. That can sometimes be dozens of servers that are not you, or facebook.com, in a position to read all communications between you and facebook.com.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading-to-https">Upgrading to HTTPS</h2>
<p>I hope you understand the value that HTTPS provides and the meaning behind that little lock symbol. There&rsquo;s really no downside to using HTTPS, so you should try to use it everywhere it&rsquo;s available.</p>
<p>How did it know to use HTTPS and not the regular old, unsafe HTTP when I typed in facebook.com?</p>
<p>Not all websites support HTTPS. So, when you type in facebook.com, your browser requested the HTTP version of facebook.com (<a href="http://facebook.com">http://facebook.com</a>). Facebook&rsquo;s servers then responded by redirecting you to the HTTPS version of the site (<a href="https://facebook.com">https://facebook.com</a>).</p>
<p>If you care to inspect the network traffic, you can see something like what&rsquo;s shown below. That&rsquo;s facebook telling your browser, &ldquo;We support HTTPS, and you&rsquo;re going to want to use that instead of regular old HTTP.&rdquo;</p>
<pre><code>General
  Request URL: http://facebook.com/
  Request Method: GET
  Status Code: 307 Internal Redirect
  Referrer Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
Response Headers:
  Location: https://facebook.com/
  Non-Authoritative-Reason: HSTS
...
</code></pre><p>That&rsquo;s very nice of Facebook to be looking out for my privacy and security. But we should be taking this into our own hands, and not depending on websites to upgrade us to HTTPS, and encrypt our communications.</p>
<p>Enter HTTPS Everywhere.</p>
<h2 id="https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> is a Firefox, Chrome, and Opera extension that encrypts your communications with many major websites, which makes your browsing more secure.</p>
<p>By using HTTPS Everywhere, you can rest easy knowing that your browser is doing everything it can, upgrade communications to HTTPS wherever possible, and not depend on websites themselves to secure communications.</p>

            <description>Problem Given a list of rational numbers,find their product.
Concept The reduce() function applies a function of two arguments cumulatively on a list of objects in succession from left to right to reduce it to one value. Say you have a list, say [1,2,3] and you have to find its sum.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; reduce(lambda x, y : x + y,[1,2,3]) 6 You can also define an initial value. If it is specified, the function will assume initial value as the value given, and then reduce.</description>

            <description>Problem You are given a function f(X) = X2. You are also given K lists. The ith list consists of Nielements.
You have to pick one element from each list so that the value from the equation below is maximized:
S = (f(X1) + f(X2) + &amp;hellip; + f(Xk)) % M
Xidenotes the element picked from the ith list. Find the maximized value Smaxobtained.
% denotes the modulo operator.
Note that you need to take exactly one element from each list, not necessarily the largest element.</description>

            <description>Problem Neo has a complex matrix script. The matrix script is a N X M grid of strings. It consists of alphanumeric characters, spaces and symbols (!,@,#,$,%,&amp;amp;).
To decode the script, Neo needs to read each column and select only the alphanumeric characters and connect them. Neo reads the column from top to bottom and starts reading from the leftmost column.
If there are symbols or spaces between two alphanumeric characters of the decoded script, then Neo replaces them with a single space &#39; &#39; for better readability.</description>

            <description>Problem The itertools module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination. Together, they form an iterator algebra making it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.
To read more about the functions in this module, check out their documentation here.
You are given a list of N lowercase English letters. For a given integer K, you can select any K indices (assume 1-based indexing) with a uniform probability from the list.</description>

            <description>Problem In this challenge, the task is to debug the existing code to successfully execute all provided test files.
Python supports a useful concept of default argument values. For each keyword argument of a function, we can assign a default value which is going to be used as the value of said argument if the function is called without it. For example, consider the following increment function:
def increment_by(n, increment=1): return n + increment The functions works like this:</description>

            <description>Problem You are given a spreadsheet that contains a list of N athletes and their details (such as age, height, weight and so on). You are required to sort the data based on the Kth attribute and print the final resulting table. Follow the example given below for better understanding.
Note that K is indexed from 0 to M-1, where M is the number of attributes.
Note: If two attributes are the same for different rows, for example, if two atheletes are of the same age, print the row that appeared first in the input.</description>
