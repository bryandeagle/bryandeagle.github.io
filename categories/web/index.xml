      <description>Setting up the Raspberry Pi I download the Raspberry Pi image from the official site
Securing the Raspberry Pi C
passwdI followed this article to add some reasonable security to the pi.
Since I&amp;rsquo;ve installed the firewall ufw, I&amp;rsquo;ll be allowing SSH, HTTP and HTTPS with the following commands
ufw allow SSHufw allow HTTPufw allow HTTPSConfiguring the Raspberry Pi as a Gateway Installing MITM Proxy apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt install mitmproxy</description>

      <description>One of the most fun things to play around with today is a Raspberry Pi. I&amp;rsquo;m constantly re-imaging my Raspberry Pi ,a nd so this guide walks through steps to take each time to ensure your device is sufficiently secure.
The security of your Raspberry Pi is important. Gaps in security leave your Raspberry Pi open to hackers who can then use it without your permission.
What level of security you need depends on how you wish to use your Raspberry Pi.</description>

      <title>Hands-On with TLS/SSL Certificates</title>

      <description>Introduction In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss TLS/SSL certificates. To learn more than just the theory, I&amp;rsquo;ll be acting as my own Certificate Authority, which will allow me to generate all the required files for TLS/SSL communication.
What is SSL/TLS? SSL and TLS are both cryptographic protocols used to increase security by encrypting communication over computer networks. SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer while TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. TLS is the successor of SSL 3.</description>

      <title>An Overview of the HTTPS Protocol</title>

      <description>How HTTPS Works Type facebook.com into your web browser, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see a little lock appear to the left of the URL. That lock means you are using HTTPS and signifies that your connection to facebook.com is secure.
Using HTTPS over the older, not secure, HTTP has two benefits:
 The website your browser is talking to has proven itself to be facebook.com and is not just pretending to be. The communications your browser sends to the website are encrypted so that no-one except your browser and the website can read them.</description>
